I've made several strawberry wheat beers, using frozen strawberries, cooked and pureed fresh berries, strawberry flavoring, and by combining frozen strawberries with flavoring. I always add the strawberries after primary fermentation is complete because the strawberry flavor would be driven off by the vigorous fermentation. Different people have tried these beers and everyone's favorite was when I added frozen strawberries to secondary with 2 oz of flavoring for 5 gallons at the time of bottling. I always use 1 lb of strawberries per gallon. I use the frozen strawberries straight out of the bag, with no boiling, steeping, or anything else to sanitize. I keep them in the bag, let them thaw, mash them up with a rolling pin, pull open the bag and dump them in. Adding strawberries has always started up fermentation again, so I make sure there's enough head space. I find that using only strawberries, or using only 1 lb of strawberries per gallon, leaves a very subtle taste. People that have tried it taste something, but can't quite figure it out. Artificial flavoring tastes, well, artificial. But combining the two has given me the best results. I've been meaning to try another strawberry wheat beer by adding more than 1lb/gallon of strawberries and using no artificial flavoring, I just haven't gotten around to it. Also, I find these beers needed more time to condition in the bottle. There was a period of a few weeks where the taste was very tart, or like ripe fruit, but in time it went away and there was a nice strawberry flavor.
