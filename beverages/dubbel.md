2.5gal batch

# Yeast
- wlp-530
- I typically pitch at 64F, let it self-rise to 70F, hold for 2 days, then ramp 2F/day to 78F and hold there. I've won awards for tripels and BDSA's using this method.
- 90 minute boil with hops, adjuncts and nutrients as timed. Chill to 65F. Oxygenate 30 seconds. Ramp primary up to 78F for 6-7 days. At 1.010 rack off yeast to secondary and crash to 50F. Hold for 3-4 days until FG is reached. Bottle using heavy Belgian bottles or Champagne bottles. Prime with 34g/gal Simplicity Candi Syrup. Let bottle carb for 10 days at 76F. Cellar for 6 months.
- pitch over belgian pumpkin starter from 10/xx/21. yeast calculator 100b cells -> ~650b post-fermentation.
- require 220billion
