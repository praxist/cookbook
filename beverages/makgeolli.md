rice flour water yeast nuruk starter

add rice in stages afterwards


A good ratio to stick with it is one liter of water to one kg of rice, but with a samyangju, I never add water on the last dotsul and try to split it with the first two stages. So, if I’m using 10 kg total of rice 1st - 2.5 kg and 5 L then 2nd - 2.5 kg and 5 L - 3rd 5 kg rice


I’m make makgeolli for the first time in a few days and have a few questions:

    How much wine yeast do I use?

    Can I just use bakers yeast instead?

    Is glutinous rice the best to use?

    1:1:0.1 rice:water:nuruk - This ratio seems to be the most popular, is this okay?

    The wine yeast packet is usually good for a 5-gallon batch of wine, check the info on the back to make sure. I usually sprinkle in a part of it if my batch is smaller than 5 gallons.

    Baker's yeast will produce alcohol too, but it's usually not optimized for making wine. The yeast does play a non-insignificant role in flavour and overall fermentation. So, I'd use wine yeast if I can and would recommend that you do so. If you want to try using bread yeast, then perhaps you can give it a shot.

    I've seen glutinous rice recipes and have tried it a handful of times, but personally not sure if that is the "best". There are a lot of slight variations in recipes, some even include wheat flour. As far as I could find, traditionally "the best" and the highest quality ones would have been made with steamed rice cakes. I'd say don't worry too much and make what you can and try out different stuff.

    1 to 1 with rice to water sounds good. It's generally a good idea to add just enough to submerge the rice and not add more since extra water is associated with increased sourness. The 10% ratio of rice to nuruk also sounds fine. The home recipes are usually all over the place with how much to use and I doubt it is an exact science. I read that using too much will impart undesirable flavour, it might be better to say on the low end than to add more.

90g nuruk 3g yeast
500g rice flour
50g wheat flour
50g DME
1.5L water, campden or spring
300g nuruk?



    24C flour mixture
    ideal 22.5C 72F



    800g flour
    2.4L boiling water
    480g nuruk
    2days



# 20230606 - Samyangju
## Phase 1
- 150g nuruk
- 3g d47 (1/2 packet)
- 50g AP flour
- 50g DME
- 250g glutinous rice flour
- 250g rice flour
- 1.5L water, with campden

- boil water with campden
- weigh out all flours into mixing bowl
- slowly pour water and stir in increments
- chill mixing bowl to 72F
- add nuruk and d47, mix
- wipe mixing bowl sides, cover cheescloth
- mixture should liquify over time

- over next 48 hours, stir every 12 hours to oxygenate
- T+12hrs: very yeasty
- T+48hrs: souring a bit.

## Phase 2
- 200g glutinous rice flour
- 200g rice flour
- 100g DME

- repeat as above in larger mixing bowl
- when cool, pour starter into larger mixing bowl

- over next 24 hours, stir every 12 hours

## Phase 3
- 2kg sweet rice

- in nylon brew bag, wash rice 6x+ times until water mostly clear
- soak rice in bag for 6 hours
- let rice drain for 30 minutes

- steam rice 40 minutes: line steamer with cheesecloth, pile rice but leave hole in middle of rice pile for steam to rise
- cool rice to 25C

- rice in brew bag
- brew bag in sanitized fermentation bucket
- pour mixing bowl contents over bag

- fridge at 60F (maybe 62 next time)

- T+0hrs: rice absorbs all contents
- T+5d: rice starting to liquify a bit. do i have enough nuruk / enzymes? taste is quite pungent/alcoholic, sweet, taste is good after initial harshness
- T+14d: squeezed out liquid from rice, cold crash 34F
- T+16d: bottling/kegging.
  - roughly 1gal total yield:
  - 500mL cheongju. quite viscous and ropy (pedio?) small hint of white pellicle. taste is quite sake like, rather sweet, moderately syrupy
  - 0.75gal takju. diluted 1.5:1 takju to water, kegged. pressurized to 40psi
  - <500mL lees left in bucket, diluted with 1.5:1 water:lees. actually quite pleasant. very thick
