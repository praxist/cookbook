Philadelphia Fish House Punch

    1 pound superfine sugar
    12 lemons, peeled
    16 oz Appleton V/X rum
    8 oz Smith and Cross rum
    12 oz Hennessy VS cognac
    3 oz Briotette creme de peche
    9 oz Laird's applejack
    16 oz lemon juice, finely strained
    6 pints cold water

    Place sugar and lemon peels into a vaccum-seal bag and seal according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Let rest at room temperature for four hours, or overnight, until the sugar is soaked in lemon oil.
    When punch is ready to assemble, pour contents into an eight-quart container and add the rest of the ingredients. Makes approximately 5½ quarts.
