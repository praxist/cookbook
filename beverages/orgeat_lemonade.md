ORGEAT SYRUP 3 cups sugar in the raw 2 cups unsweetened almond milk 1 tsp orange blossom water 1/2 tsp rose water 1/2 tsp almond extract In a medium sauce pan, combine sugar and almond milk. Stir over heat until sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from heat and add orange blossom water, rose water, and almond extract. Stir to combine. Let cool and pour into a serving bottle (I use recycled liquor bottles so I can use speed pourers). Stays good in the refrigerator for a month or so.

Orange blossom water, rose water, & almond extract can be purchased on Amazon. Cortas makes great rose water & orange blossom water. Has a pretty good shelf life. Watkins & McCormick almond extract will do.


This is "Orgeat Lemonade"; 2oz Orgeat Syrup, 2oz Fresh Squeezed Lemon Juice, shake for 5-8 seconds with ice, strain into a 16oz glass of your choice, fill with fresh ice, top with soda water. Garnish ideas include lemon peel, lemon slice, maraschino cherry, fresh grated nutmeg, mint bouquet, tiki parasol.
