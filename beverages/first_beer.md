2.5gal:

- 1.9g gypsum caso4
- 0.1g epsom
- 0.2g chalk
- 1/8 campden tablet

mashing
- heat water for mash - to 153 + 5deg
- wrap mesh around top of pot
- stir grains slowly, dont clump
- mash for 1hr, stir around occassionally
- preboil gravity measurement / hydrometer reading

sterilize + get ready:
- kettle
- racking cane
- turkey baster
- spray bottle
- foil for kettle
- fermenting bucket
- hydrometer
- hop spider
- temp probes

boil mash / mash out
- take grains out, put on collander
- opening gravity measurement / hydrometer reading
- 1.20 / 52

mistakes:
let in some grain missing the grain bag in mash step. bag a bit too small?
added too much water trying preboil calculation
didnt cover mash and just let sit on simmer
really hard to squeeze the bag - didnt fit in collander
boiled first 0.5oz cascade longer than needed due to long 90 minute boil
boiled second 1oz cascade for like 20 minutes instead of 10 looking for caraggeenan
didnt measure temp in the fermenter before pitching yeast (was actually 75 tho probe said 70 in the pot)
pitched yeast at 75 vs 68

changes: less water. did ~4 gallons for 2.5 yield... instead got __
dont lose the carageenan
take post boil hydrometer reading after coolign wort
~35 minutes to 70F - one water bath in sink, drain, then another with bag of ice
