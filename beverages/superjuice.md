10 limes yielding ~250ml of lime juice

10 lime zest, 30g citric acid, 20g sugar, 12g malic acid, 1g salt, 1g Vitamin C, 1g MSG

I like adding the sugar to the oleocitrate and leaving for about 2 hours, add about 100ml of water, blend, and then add the rest of the 650ml of water, yielding 1 liter.

For lemons:

5 lemons, yielding 250ml of lemon juice

5 lemon zests, 40g citric acid, 20g sugar, 5g malic acid, 1g msg, 1g salt, 1g Vitamin C

Do the same thing with 750ml of water the same way.

I use a decent amount early and then freeze the rest and pull it out the day before I need it, usually takes about a month or so to go through, but only out in the fridge for like 5-10 days at a time.

I find with the small amount of salt, msg, and the actual sugar it pops more.
