We started out using the clawhammer recipe. Our house was going through 5 gal kegs so fast, I went as simple as I could to speed up the process.

Here are some things I've tried. Everything added to the keg

4-5 gallons of filtered water

Add any flavoring you want

Bottle of pomegranate juice (no hops, but simple and turned out good) Or

1oz cryo (don't know if it matters) hops in mesh strainer with pineapple juice. Or

1oz cryo hops with handful of mint leaves in mesh strainer. Or

1 oz hops in strainer and some big squirts of lemon and lime juice from bottles.

Not boiling and cooling saves a ton of time.

30psi for about 2 days

20psi after that for serving pressure.

DO NOT USD HOP RESIN EXTRACT!

does not mix with water well. Makes everything sticky. 0/10 never again



Rather than boiling a bunch of hops, I threw a couple of ounces of hops in a jar with some neutral spirits and let them extract in the fridge overnight. Most of the sludge sinks to the bottom and you can draw off the liquid. Chuck that in a keg with some deaerated water and a little mineral addition for taste.

It's not 100% alcohol free. But like 100 mL in 19 liters is less than a quarter of a percent alcohol. It's less than you'll find naturally in just about any fruit juice.



I dry hopped a 5g keg with an ounce of citra in one of those stainless steel mesh tubes (which I just left in the keg). It is pretty good, and people seem to like it (at least as a novelty). I drink it regularly and like it. The hop flavor does change/fade over time and is very potent the first few days.

Next time I am adding some lemon or lime juice (not sure on quantity yet) and I got a floating dip tube. The dry hop matter is extremely obvious in water, and the first 5-6 pints were literally green.



Since I was using distilled water, I needed to build up my water profile. I followed my same water profile for a yellow, hoppy beer found on BeerSmith.

5.6 g Gypsum CaSO4
0 g    Table Salt NaCl
9.9 g Epsom Salt MgSO4
2.9 g Calcium Chloride CaCl
2.3 g Baking Soda NaHCO3
5.4 g Chalk CaCo



7g/L of (bagged) hops in a hop stand for 20 mins at around 70 Celsius
I recently bought a 2.5 gallon keg for this and it has turned out great. I boil about A gallon of water, then let it cool to 170f and add 5g of hops per gallon (so I still add the final I want at the end).
5g per gallon? Wow i do 2.5 gal batches and do 5g total.
