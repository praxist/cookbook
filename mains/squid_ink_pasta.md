spaghetti squid ink sauce
- san marzano tomatoes
- pasata
- onion - got
- garlic - got
- pecorino
- basil
- cherry tomato - got
- shrimp
- scallop
- coarse semolina
- semolina rimacinata


1:1:0.8-0.9 of semolina, AP flour, and water (similar to the handmade pasta dough recipe I use) - so 5 oz of each flour and 4-4.5 oz of water.
Your dough recipe has to be SO crumbly. And go into the machine crumbly (as pictured), which means much less hydration. I don’t use eggs for extruded shapes. My recipe is 36% hydration, adding a bit more water 1 tbs at a time until it just sticks together when you squeeze it with your fingers. This was 400g semola rimacinata, 100g coarse semolina, 180g water to start and about 4 more tbs once it started coming together in my mixer. I let the mixer mix with the dough hook for 10 minutes in lieu of “kneading” since you can’t form this into a ball. But as you can see, the dough squished together/gets kneaded in the press and turns into noodles! Hope this is helpful.
