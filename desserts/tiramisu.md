# 1/2 recipe

Zabaglione:
- 2 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup dry marsala
- 1/4 cup sugar
- double boiler, whisk
- ~160F peak temp
- strain out solids/chunks
- cool immediately

Cream:
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- beat until stiff
- speed 7, 5min

- 8oz mascarpone
- add to ^, beat until smooth. low speed? sometimes chunks not blending

- add zabaglione to ^
- if zabaglione too hot, may cause cream to separate!

- 1 1/4 cup cold brew (french roast) - 4:1 water bean ratio. optional: add instant espresso powder
- 1/4 cup biscotti liqueur

- pack of ladyfingers
- when adding cream push through a large strainer for a more smooth and airy texture

- 2oz grated 70% chocolate
- if food processing chocolate instead, use less. chunky texture not as good

- cocoa powder for dustin
